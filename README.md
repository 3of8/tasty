**Tasty** is a modern testing framework for Haskell.

It lets you combine your unit tests, golden tests, QuickCheck/SmallCheck
properties and any other types of tests into a single test suite.

The features include:

* Run tests in parallel but report results in a deterministic order
* Filter the tests to be run using patterns specified on the command line
* Hierarchical, colored display of test results
* Reporting of test statistics
* Extensibility: add your own test providers above and beyond those provided
